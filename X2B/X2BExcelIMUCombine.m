% normal set up stuff
% loop through subjects
% for a given subj load their Excel data file (.mat) and combined IMU
% file(.mat) 
% match up a trial from the excel with the corresponding IMU file/metrics
% compare IMU metrics for the paired comparisons (ie which file/trial had
% greater sway) 
% confirm that IMU paired comparison results match (or maybe don't match )
% the results of verbal reporting paired comparisons  (consitency)

%plot results
% make bar/box plots of just paired comparison results (should look like
% the plots in X2BExcel Plots (can copy that code)

% comparisons
